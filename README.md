Git a bit
---------

### What is it?

An application to search repositories on github and see the details of repositories.
You can see list of contributors, latest commits and projection of commits on a timeline for selected repository.

### Motivation

Experimental single page application using AngularJS and github api.

### Installation

* git clone https://github.com/erhangundogan/git-a-bit.git

* cd git-a-bit

* bower install

* python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 // or npm start

### Issues

* Excessive usage of application may cause github api to stop responding. Check out console. (Workaround: You need to change your ip address to go on using or you need authentication implementation to github in application)

* TDD is not applied, so tests are in progress.
